<body><h1>ABOUT US</h1>

<img src="images/worker.jpg" alt="aboutus" style="width:700px;height:400px;padding-left:30px;">
<p><b>Eater V </b>is a national publication dedicated to reporting on, telling stories about, and critically examining the world of food and drink, with a particular focus on vegan restaurants. We are actively seeking pitches from journalists, writers, academics, filmmakers, and other contributors of all backgrounds, especially those whose voices are often underrepresented in media. Food and restaurants are among the most dynamic and powerful lenses for storytelling, and we particularly enjoy hearing from writers whose interests, experiences, and areas of expertise originate outside of the food world.</p>
<p>Eater's reports section uses original reporting to inform readers about the things they obsess over: food, restaurants, and most crucially, why food and restaurants matter. Generally speaking, these stories are 1,800 words or less paced read, but rich enough to leave the reader well armed for dinner party conversation and are usually assigned with a lead time of a few days to two weeks.</p>
